**💬 Sentiment Analysis – BERT-Based Text Classification**
This project performs Sentiment Analysis on user-provided text, classifying it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It can be integrated into applications for analyzing product reviews, customer feedback, or social media posts.

**📌 Key Features**
**🤖 BERT Transformer Model** – Leverages state-of-the-art NLP architecture for accurate sentiment classification.

**📝 Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stopword removal, and padding for consistent input.

**📊 Multi-Class Output** – Supports Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiment labels.

**☁ Firebase Integration** – Stores analyzed feedback for further business insights.

**🔄 Real-Time Analysis** – Can be used in live applications to instantly detect sentiment.

**🛠 Customizable** – Can be fine-tuned for different domains (e.g., movie reviews, product reviews, customer service).

**🛠 Methodology**
**Data Collection** – Text dataset with labeled sentiment.

**Data Preprocessing** – Tokenization using BERT tokenizer.

**Model Training** – Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model on the dataset.

**Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score tracking.

**Deployment** – Flask API for real-time sentiment prediction.

**📂 Files in This Repository**
**app.py** – Flask API for serving the sentiment model.

**sentiment_model/** – Saved fine-tuned BERT model weights.

**firebase_config.json** – Firebase configuration for storing results.

README.md – Project documentation (this file).

**🎯 Why This Project?**
Understanding customer sentiment is critical for businesses. This project combines modern NLP techniques with real-time API integration to make sentiment analysis practical and deployable in any application.
